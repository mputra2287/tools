# Musikcube 
is another free and opensource terminal-based music player that leverages a collection of plugins written in C++ to provide functionality such as data streaming, digital signal processing, output handling and so much more.

Musikcube is a cross-platform music player that can even run on Raspberry Pi. It uses the SQLite database for storing playlist and track metadata. It runs purely on a text-based UI built with ncurses.

Letâ€™s take a look at some of the key features:

    Can deliver an output of 24bit/192k audio with ease.
    The music player offers both playlists and play queue management.
    Can act as a streaming audio client on a headless server.
    Support for libraries with over 100,000 tracks.
    It provides gapless playback with cross-fading effect along with index tagging.
