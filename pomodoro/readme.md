# Pomodoro

[pomodoro](pomodoro-mx.sh) is shell script which runs prints both "RESERACH" for 25 minutes 
and "BREAK" for 5 minutes in the terminal. It creates beep sound when finalising
each section. Also, you can put an N at the end of the script to set the number of pomodoros
as shown below.

```
sh pomodoro_mx.sh N
```
