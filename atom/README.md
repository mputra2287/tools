# Atom
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor that's modern, approachable,
yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also
use productively without ever touching a config file.

## Installation/Uninstall in Ubuntu 18.04x64
Run [install-atom](install-atom.sh)
```
sh install-atom.sh
sh uninstall-atom.sh
```

## Setting up the spell-check
```
sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-gb
```

## Grammar
* For spell check using latex, you  have to add the scope name [`text.tex.latex`]
to the list of grammars that the spell check package checks. Such grammar options
are into the settings of the spell-check package.
