# PowerShell
`PowerShell for every system!` 

## Download 

### windows
1. Download stable version installer msi: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.1.3
2. Double-click the installer and select path `C:\Program Files (x86)\PowerShell\`
3. Deactivate Optional Actions (which leads to future investigations)
4. Launch and test it. Type powershell in the searchbar 

## Usage
Pretty much cd, mkdir works, but these are few comments that I commonly use
* Create a new file
Out-File -FilePath README.md
* Delete a path or file 
```
Remove-Item .\help\
Remove-Item .\README.md
```
